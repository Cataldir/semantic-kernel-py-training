# Researcher Pattern

The researcher pattern implements a RAG that extracts and solidifies information from a broadness of different sources and consolidates that information. The major concern here is to summarize different informations from different data sources in a single prompt or pipeline, without the need to implement different specialists or operators on each request. The Research pattern implements the retrieval on different data sources provided that they are relevant for the given problem, reducing the amount of code and reasoning needed to be done to achieve a proper answer.

**Associated Software Design Pattern**: The researcher selects which retrieval stores should be used based on the type of request, visiting its definitions and reasoning about its usages prior to implementing the execution, thus following the [Visitor Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/visitor).

## Intent of the Pattern

The Researcher Pattern is designed to efficiently gather and synthesize information from a wide array of diverse sources. Its primary intent is to streamline the process of information retrieval and consolidation. By doing so, it aims to provide comprehensive, context-aware insights or answers by aggregating data from multiple sources. This pattern is particularly valuable in scenarios where a holistic understanding is required, drawn from various data points.

### Problem It Solves

In complex systems, there's often a need to extract and integrate information from multiple sources. Traditionally, this would require deploying numerous specialized modules or operators, each tailored to a specific data source. This approach is not only resource-intensive but also complicates the system architecture. The Researcher Pattern addresses this by offering a unified framework that can adaptively retrieve and compile data across different domains, thereby simplifying the workflow and reducing the cognitive load on developers.

### How It Implements a Solution

The Researcher Pattern implements a solution by using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. This technique allows the system to dynamically select relevant data sources based on the context of the request. It visits and evaluates each potential source, determining its applicability before extracting information. This selective retrieval is key to its efficiency, as it prevents the system from being overwhelmed with irrelevant data. Once the relevant information is gathered, the pattern then synthesizes it into a coherent response or summary, effectively consolidating diverse data into a single, manageable output.

## Convergence with the Visitor Pattern

In software engineering, the Visitor Pattern involves an operation to be performed on elements of an object structure, where the visitor defines a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates. Similarly, the Researcher Pattern visits different data sources (akin to the elements in the Visitor Pattern) and decides which ones to use based on the type of request (the new operation). This allows for a flexible and extensible way to interact with various data sources without the need to alter their underlying structures. It embodies the principles of the Visitor Pattern by externalizing the retrieval logic, making it independent of the data sourcesâ€™ own structures.

In summary, the Researcher Pattern offers a streamlined, efficient approach to information retrieval and consolidation from multiple sources, embodying principles of the Visitor Pattern to achieve adaptability and scalability in complex information environments.
